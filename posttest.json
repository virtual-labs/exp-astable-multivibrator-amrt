      "question": "The two output waves of an astable multivibrator are ------------ degrees out of phase with each other.",

        "a": "90",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect—this phase difference is not typical.",
        "b": "Correct—one transistor is ON while the other is OFF.",
        "c": "270° phase difference is not applicable here.",
        "d": "Incorrect—they are not in phase."

      "question": "The frequency of oscillation of an astable multivibrator depends on",
      "answers": {
        "a": "value of collector load resistor",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Collector resistor affects voltage swing, not frequency directly.",
        "b": "Correct—the RC time constant controls charging/discharging rate.",
        "c": "β affects gain, but not frequency.",
        "d": "No input pulse in astable mode—it oscillates on its own."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "A β of 1 is insufficient for switching.",
        "b": "Correct—β must be high enough to ensure saturation and cutoff transitions.",
        "c": "Insufficient gain—transistor won’t switch properly.",
