        "a": "positive feedback",

        "c": "both positive and negative feedback",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Positive feedback is used in multivibrators to maintain or change states rapidly.",
        "b": "Negative feedback stabilizes amplifiers, not suitable for multivibrators.",
        "c": "Only positive feedback is used.",
        "d": "Feedback is essential in multivibrators to maintain oscillation or bistability."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Monostable multivibrator has one stable state.",
        "b": "Bistable multivibrator has two stable states.",
        "c": "Astable has no stable states—it keeps toggling.",
